# Pre-Requisites

The **PhraseTractor** tool is a Java tool and, as such, its a good idea to have:
- a [Java Runtime](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) (JRE) installed to execute the JAR file and have
- a [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) (JDK) to compile, debug, and compile the tool

I am also using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an editor to debug, run or edit Java.
